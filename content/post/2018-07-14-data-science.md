### The Definition of a Data Scientist ^[Master's in data science:[www.mastersindatascience.org](http://www.mastersindatascience.org/)]###

Data science was developed to handle the flood of big data engulfing the world. A blend of statisticians, computer scientists and creative thinkers, data scientists have the:

  • **Skills** to collect, process and extract value from giant and diverse data sets  
  • **Imagination** to understand, visualize and communicate their findings to non-data scientists  
  • **Ability** to create data-driven solutions that boost profits, reduce costs and even help save the world  


### DATA ENGINEERS vs DATA SCIENTISTS 区别? ###
DATA ENGINEERS：创建数据模型、搭建管道提供数据。  
DATA SCIENTISTS：分析、可视化数据，并讲述数据背后故事的人。

他们的工作最终都是为提高商业利润、激发更好的idea提供辅助。
