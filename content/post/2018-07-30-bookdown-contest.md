> **Author Information**:Vicky Steeves, Librarian for Research Data Management and Reproducibility, New York University. I was NDSR ’14 in NYC. I worked at the American Museum of Natural History, and my project was to basically interview all the curators in the museum and their scientific staff (postdocs, grad studets, technicians, etc.), and the collection managers (some based in the Library, some in the Scientific Divisions). Based on the information I gleaned from the interviews, I wrote a report outlining the biggest preservation risks, ongoing data curation needs, and options for long-term digital preservation.

**[UUtah 2018 Reproducibility Immersive Course](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/2018-uutah-repro/index.html)**  

> This 5-day course provides an opportunity to explore issues of research reproducibility in-depth in a seminar-type setting, followed by hands-on sessions to learn actionable, practical solutions to make your own work more reproducible. You can choose to attend some or all of the sessions. The final day of the workshop is the conference Building Research Integrity through Reproducibility which requires a separate registration.


**[NDSR Art Immersion Week: Research with Interviews](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/2018-ndsr-art/)**

> In this session, I’ll introduce the basics of qualitative research, focusing on the research interview - a powerful method for understanding the needs and experiences of folks at your institutions. We’ll go over how to create an interview guide, interviewing tips, tools, and best practices for analyzing the resulting rich qualitative dataset.

**[Writing reprocible geoscience papers using R Markdown, Docker, and GitLab](https://vickysteeves.gitlab.io/repro-papers/)**  

> Reproducibility is unquestionably at the heart of science. Scientists face numerous challenges in this context, not least the lack of concepts, tools, and workflows for reproducible research in Today’s curricula. This short course introduces established and powerful tools that enable reproducibility of computational geoscientific research, statistical analyses, and visualisation of results using R (http://www.r-project.org/) in two lessons:  
1. Reproducible Research with R Markdown Open Data, Open Source, Open Reviews and Open Science are important aspects of science today. In the first lesson, basic motivations and concepts for reproducible research touching on these topics are briefly introduced. During a hands-on session the course participants write R Markdown (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents, which include text and code and can be compiled to static documents (e.g. HTML, PDF). R Markdown is equally well suited for day-to-day digital notebooks as it is for scientific publications when using publisher templates.  
2. GitLab and Docker In the second lesson, the R Markdown files are published and enriched on an online collaboration platform. Participants learn how to save and version documents using GitLab (http://gitlab.com/) and compile them using Docker containers (https://docker.com/). These containers capture the full computational environment and can be transported, executed, examined, shared and archived. Furthermore, GitLab’s collaboration features are explored as an environment for Open Science.
